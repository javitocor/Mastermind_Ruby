# Mastermind
I built a mastermind game on the command line. A human player can either solve the game themselves, or two users can play, one as the codemaker and the other as the player.

# Built With

# Live demo

You can find it here [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/javitocor/Mastermind_Ruby)](https://repl.it/github/javitocor/Mastermind_Ruby)

# Getting Started
Clone the project on your local machine, cd to the folder, and then run "./bin/start.rb" on your terminal

# Instructions to Play
- Select the player name.

- Select who wants to be the codemaker, the computer or a player.

- The code can be made up of any combination of the colored pegs. You may not use two or more pegs of the same color.

- The colors are red, green, brown, magenta ,blue and cyan.

- Once the code is set, the Decoder can begin guessing, trying to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the hidden Code pegs.

- Each guess is made by placing a row of Code pegs on the unit. 

- After every guess, the result of fails and matches will be displayed.

- Player has 15 tries.
